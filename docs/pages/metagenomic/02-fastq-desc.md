## Bioinformatic workflows

When working with high-throughput sequencing data, the raw reads you get off the sequencer must pass
through several different tools to generate your final desired output. The execution of this set of
tools in a specified order is commonly referred to as a *workflow* or a *pipeline*. 

An example of the workflow we will be using for our analysis is provided below, with a brief
description of each step.

</a>


1. Quality control - Assessing quality using FastQC and Trimming and/or filtering reads (if necessary)
2. Assembly of metagenome
3. Binning
4. Taxonomic assignation

These workflows in bioinformatics adopt a plug-and-play approach in that the output of one tool can be easily
used as input to another tool without any extensive configuration. Having standards for data formats is what 
makes this feasible. Standards ensure that data is stored in a way that is generally accepted and agreed upon 
within the community. Therefore, the tools used to analyze data at different workflow stages are  
built, assuming that the data will be provided in a specific format.  

## Quality control

We will now assess the quality of the sequence reads contained in our FASTQ files.

### Details on the FASTQ format

Although it looks complicated (and it is), we can understand the [FASTQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) format with a little decoding. Some rules about the format include the following:  

|Line|Description|   
|----|-----------|     
|1|Always begins with '@' followed by the information about the read|  
|2|The actual DNA sequence|  
|3|Always begins with a '+' and sometimes contains the same info as in line 1|  
|4|Has a string of characters which represent the quality scores; must have same number of characters as line 2|  

We can view the first complete read in one of the files from our dataset using `head` to look at
the first four lines. But we have to decompress one of the files first.

Line 4 shows the quality of each nucleotide in the read. Quality is interpreted as the 
probability of an incorrect base call (e.g., 1 in 10) or, equivalently, the base call 
accuracy (e.g., 90%). Each nucleotide's numerical score's value is converted into a character code where every single character 
represents a quality score for an individual nucleotide. This conversion allows the alignment of each individual nucleotide with its quality
score. For example, in the line
above, the quality score line is: 

~~~

~~~
{: .output}

The numerical value assigned to each character depends on the 
sequencing platform that generated the reads. The sequencing machine used to generate our data 
uses the standard Sanger quality PHRED score encoding, using Illumina version 1.8 onwards.
Each character is assigned a quality score between 0 and 41, as shown in 
the chart below.

~~~
Quality encoding: !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJ
                   |         |         |         |         |
Quality score:    01........11........21........31........41                                
~~~
{: .output}

Each quality score represents the probability that the corresponding nucleotide call is
incorrect. These probability values are the results of the base calling algorithm and depend on how 
much signal was captured for the base incorporation. This quality score is logarithmically based, so a quality score of 10 reflects a
base call accuracy of 90%, but a quality score of 20 reflects a base call accuracy of 99%.

We can now see that there is a range of quality scores but that the end of the sequence is
very poor (`#` = a quality score of 2). 

## Assessing read quality using FASTqe
 
 This symbol can be hard to interpet, that's why we are going to use our first tool to have a better understanding of the data: fastqE.
 FastQE turns ASCII characters into emojis that are easy to interpret.

 We are going to use a Bioinformatic tool named Galaxy.
