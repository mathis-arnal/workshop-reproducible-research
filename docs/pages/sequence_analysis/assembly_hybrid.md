# Hybrid Genome Assembly using long and short reads data

In this practical we will perform the assembly of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, using the short and the long reads that we have trimmed in previous tutorials.


## Getting the data

We have trimmed the raw short-reads and the long reads in the previous steps of the training, so we will now assemble them into longer sequences called contigs, using a method of hybrid assembly combining both long and short reads, with the [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler) pipeline.

Find your 3 fastq(.gz) files containing the trimmed reads for strain K2.

```bash
cd results
ls -l
```

## Unicycler hybrid assembly

As you might have noticed, assemblies can take some time. For that reason, we will prepare a `unicycler_assembly_K2.sh` script that we will run on the Slurm job scheduler, using the `sbatch` command.

!!! tip
    You need to ask the teacher which partition to use !

```
#!/bin/bash
## SLURM CONFIG ##

#SBATCH --job-name=unicycler
#SBATCH --output=%x.%j.out
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 4
#SBATCH --time=24:00:00
#SBATCH -p SELECTED_PARTITION
#SBATCH --mail-type=FAIL,END
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4G

##
module load bioinfo/racon/1.4.3
module load bioinfo/unicycler/0.4.4

unicycler -1 K2_Illu_R1_trimmed.fastq -2 K2_Illu_R2_trimmed.fastq --long K2_MinION.fastq.gz \
  -o K2_unicycler_assembly -t 4

```

When you think that your script is ready, you can run the job with SLURM using this command (exit the `srun` if it is still active):

```bash
sbatch unicycler_assembly_K2.sh
```

Then check that your script is "Running" by typing:
```bash
squeue

## to see only your jobs, select the user
squeue -u your_login
```

The result of the assembly is in the directory `K2_unicycler_assembly` under the name `assembly.fasta`
First, have a look of the Unicycler output directory.

!!! question
    what are the different files there?
Check the assembly graph (gfa file) with Bandage => you will need to use the `scp` command from your computer.


Let's now make a link of the file containing the assembled scaffolds, to simplify the run of Quast and BUSCO

```bash
ln -s K2_unicycler_assembly/assembly.fasta K2_unicycler_scaffolds.fasta
```

and look at it

```bash
head K2_unicycler_scaffolds.fasta
```

## Quality of the Assembly

QUAST is a software evaluating the quality of genome assemblies by computing various metrics, including

First we might need to type the `srun` command to book the resources (the previous step was with `sbatch`):

```bash
srun -p SELECTED_PARTITION --cpus-per-task 2 --pty bash -i
```

Run Quast on your assembly (type the srun command first if this is not done already)

```bash
module load bioinfo/quast/5.0.2
module load bioinfo/bedtools/2.30.0
module load bioinfo/minimap2/2.24

quast.py -o K2_unicycler_quast -t 2 --conserved-genes-finding --gene-finding \
  --pe1 K2_Illu_trimmed_R1.fastq.gz --pe2 K2_Illu_trimmed_R2.fastq.gz K2_unicycler_scaffolds.fasta
```

and take a look at the text report

```bash
cat K2_unicycler_quast/report.txt
```

!!! question
    How well does the assembly total size and coverage correspond to your earlier estimation?

!!! question
    How many contigs in total did the assembly produce?

!!! question
    Has the assembly improved compared with short-reads only assembly? in term of N50 and L50 for example.


Let's now check the completeness in term of essential genes expected with BUSCO

## Assembly Completeness

You can find more info regarding BUSCO in the short-reads assembly tutorial.
Let's run it !

```bash
module load bioinfo/BUSCO/5.2.2

busco -i K2_unicycler_scaffolds.fasta -o K2_unicycler_busco --mode genome --lineage_dataset enterobacterales_odb10
```

!!! question
    How many marker genes has `busco` found?
    Was this number improved compared to previous assemblies of short-reads only and long-reads only ?
